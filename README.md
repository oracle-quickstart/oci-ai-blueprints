## Blueprints

Blueprints go beyond basic Terraform templates. Each blueprint:

- Offers validated hardware suggestions (e.g., optimal shapes, CPU/GPU configurations),
- Includes end-to-end application stacks customized for different GenAI use cases, and
- Comes with monitoring, logging, and auto-scaling configured out of the box.

After you install OCI AI Blueprints to an OKE cluster in your tenancy, you can deploy these pre-built blueprints:
