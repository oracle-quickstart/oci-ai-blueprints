## Introduction

**OCI AI Blueprints** is a streamlined, no-code solution for deploying and managing Generative AI workloads on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). By providing opinionated hardware recommendations, pre-packaged software stacks, and out-of-the-box observability tooling, OCI AI Blueprints helps you get your AI applications running quickly and efficiently—without wrestling with the complexities of infrastructure decisions, software compatibility, and MLOps best practices.

---

## Why Use OCI AI Blueprints?

Enterprises face three main challenges when running GenAI workloads on OCI:

1. **Hardware Decisions**  
   Choosing the right GPUs, networking, and storage configurations can be a painful, time-consuming process for data scientists and ML engineers.

2. **Software Stack Complexity**  
   Selecting and maintaining frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow), drivers (e.g., CUDA), and libraries can be difficult and error-prone. Ensuring ongoing compatibility can stall project timelines.

3. **Observability & MLOps**  
   Standing up a robust MLOps stack—monitoring, auto-scaling, experiment tracking—often involves Kubernetes expertise and custom tooling that can be tedious to maintain.

### How OCI AI Blueprints Solves These Challenges

1. **Validated Hardware Recommendations**  
   Deploy your GenAI workloads with confidence using pre-packaged blueprints tested on recommended OCI GPU, CPU, and networking configurations. This saves you from time-consuming performance benchmarking and guesswork.

2. **Opinionated, Pre-Packaged Software Stacks**  
   Each blueprint includes the necessary frameworks, libraries, and model configurations for a specific AI use case (e.g., RAG, fine-tuning, inference). Power users can further customize or swap out components as needed.

3. **Built-In Observability and Auto-Scaling**  
   By automating MLOps tasks—monitoring, logging, and scaling—OCI AI Blueprints simplifies infrastructure management. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, MLFlow, and KEDA are automatically installed, giving you a production-grade environment with minimal effort.

## What Are Blueprints?

Blueprints go beyond basic Terraform templates. Each blueprint:

- Offers validated hardware suggestions (e.g., optimal shapes, CPU/GPU configurations).
- Includes end-to-end application stacks customized for different GenAI use cases.
- Comes with monitoring, logging, and auto-scaling configured out of the box.

After you install OCI AI Blueprints in your tenancy, you can deploy these pre-built blueprints (and more) quickly and reliably:

| Blueprint                    | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **LLM Inference**            | Deploy single-node inference for Llama 2/3/3.1 7B/8B models using NVIDIA GPU shapes and the vLLM inference engine with auto-scaling. |
| **Fine-Tuning Benchmarking** | Run MLCommons Llama2 quantized 70B LoRA finetuning on A100 for performance benchmarking.                                             |
| **LoRA Fine-Tuning**         | LoRA fine-tuning of custom or HuggingFace models using any dataset. Includes flexible hyperparameter tuning.                         |

## Blueprint Configuration

When deploying blueprints, you can customize:

- **LLM Model**
- **GPU Shape**
- **GPU Node Count**
- **Auto-Scaling Settings** (min/max replicas, application metrics such as inference latency)
- **Fine-Tuning Hyperparameters** (learning rate, epochs, etc.)
- And more (see [documentation](docs/api_documentation/README.md) for full details)

Sample configurations can be found [here](docs/sample_blueprints/README.md).

## Repository Contents

This repository provides comprehensive Terraform scripts that provision and configure:

1. An ATP database instance
2. Grafana & Prometheus for monitoring
3. MLFlow for experiment tracking
4. KEDA for dynamic auto-scaling
5. The OCI AI Blueprints front-end and back-end in an OKE cluster of your choice

Once installed, you can:

- Access the **OCI AI Blueprints Portal** and **API**.
- Deploy or undeploy blueprints for inference, training, and more.
- Deploy custom container images for your AI/ML workloads by simply pointing to the image URL.
