# LLM Inference with vLLM

#### Deploy open-source LLMs to GPUs for inference with vLLM.

This blueprint simplifies the deployment of LLMs using an open-source inference engine called vLLM. You can deploy a custom model or select from a variety of open-source models on Hugging Face.

The blueprint deploys the model from an object storage bucket to a GPU node or a CPU node in an OKE cluster in your tenancy. Once deployed, you receive a ready-to-use API endpoint to start generating responses from the model. For mission-critical workloads, you can also configure auto-scaling driven by application metrics like inference latency. To summarize, this blueprint streamlines inference deployment, making it easy to scale and integrate into your applications without deep, technical expertise.
