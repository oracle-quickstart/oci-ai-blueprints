# Offline Inference Blueprint - Infra (vLLM)

#### Run offline LLM inference benchmarks using vLLM with automated performance tracking and MLflow logging.

This blueprint provides a configurable framework to run **offline LLM inference benchmarks** using vLLM as the inference engine. It is designed for cloud GPU environments and supports automated performance benchmarking with MLflow logging.

This blueprint enables you to:

- Run inference locally on GPU nodes using pre-loaded models
- Benchmark token throughput, latency, and request performance
- Push results to MLflow for comparison and analysis

## When to use Offline inference

Offline inference is ideal for:

- Accurate performance benchmarking (no API or network bottlenecks)
- Comparing GPU hardware performance (A10, A100, H100, MI300X)
- Evaluating backend frameworks (inference engines) like vLLM

## Supported Backends

| Backend | Description                                                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| vllm    | Token streaming inference engine for LLMs with speculative decoding |

---

## Running the Benchmark

- Things need to run the benchmark
  - Your MLFlow URL (this can be found via the GET `workspace/` endpoint or under the `Deployments` tab if using the portal)
  - A node pool with GPU hardware (this can be done by deploying the shared node pool pre-filled sample [here](shared_node_pool_a10.json))
  - Model checkpoints pre-downloaded and stored in an object storage.
  - Make sure to get a PAR for the object storage where the models are saved. With listing, write and read perimissions
  - Configured benchmarking blueprint - make sure to update the MLFlow URL (ex `https://mlflow.121-158-72-41.nip.io`)

This blueprint supports benchmark execution via job-mode (the benchmarking container will spin up, benchmark, then spin down once the benchmarking is complete). The recipe mounts a model from Object Storage (hence the need for a PAR link), runs offline inference, and logs metrics to MlFlow.
