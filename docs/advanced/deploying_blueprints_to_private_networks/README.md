# Deploying Blueprints into private networks

This document contains two parts. The first describes using our Quickstart to deploy an OKE cluster into a pre-existing private network with no public access, and the second describes deploying blueprints onto an OKE cluster with no public access.

## Deploying OKE Stack into pre-existing private subnets

We do not create new completely locked down private subnets, but we do support them from a "bring your own" perspective if you'd like to deploy a new OKE cluster into one.

Deploying into a private subnet may likely mean the subsequent Blueprints deployment cannot be installed with the "Stack", as the stack communicates with the cluster over a public endpoint from the internet. If it is acceptable for you to have a public API endpoint but only private worker nodes, **return to the original deployment in [getting started](../../../GETTING_STARTED_README.md)**, otherwise continue.

1. Click **Deploy to Oracle Cloud** above.
2. In **Create Stack**:
   - Give your stack a **name** (e.g., _oke-stack_).
   - Select the **compartment** where you want OCI AI Blueprints deployed.
3. Click "Show advanced options?"
4. Under **Network Configuration** click "bring_your_own", and populate the vcn, and subnets for the API Endpoint, Worker Nodes, and Load Balancer.
5. Under **OKE Cluster Configuration** for set both visibility types to **Private**.
6. Populate the number of worker nodes for the control plane, the shape, and the pool name, then click **Next**, then **Create**, and finally choose **Run apply** to provision your cluster.
7. Monitor the progress in **Resource Manager â†’ Stacks**. Once the status is **Succeeded**, you have a functional VCN and an OKE cluster ready to host OCI AI Blueprints.

## Deploying Blueprints with Terraform

If your networking setup does not allow for installation via the stack deployment in the OCI console, it is still possible to deploy with terraform locally using the following steps:

1. Setup a bastion or get on a workstation with the ability to communicate with your cluster's API Endpoint. An example document is given above.
2. Install the Terraform CLI from [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) from the bastioned host.
3. Install the OCI CLI from [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm) and configure authentication in your `~/.oci/config` according to [this](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliconfigure.htm).
4. Clone our GitHub repository locally, and change directory into `oci-ai-blueprints/oci_ai_blueprints_terraform`
5. Initialize the terraform with `terraform init`.
6. Create a tfvars file in that directory called `terraform.tfvars`. The minimum variables needed are in [example_tfvars.md](./example_tfvars.md).
7. Run a `terraform plan` to ensure nothing is missing.
8. Run a `terraform apply` to install the Blueprints platform on your OKE cluster.

Depending on your setup, you may need to either setup a windows server or submit API calls directly from code from trusted sources.
