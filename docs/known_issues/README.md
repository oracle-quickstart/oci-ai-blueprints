## Shape BM.GPU4.8 Cannot Schedule Recipes

Currently, there is an Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) bug with the `BM.GPU4.8` shape.

We have diagnosed and reported the issue, and are following up with the OKE team for resolution. The error for this issue presents like:

The following `kubectl` commands can be used to diagnose pods in this state:
```bash
kubectl get pods # to find the name of the pod
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

```

## Issues Connecting to APIs via Postman or Curl

This is especially important for all POST requests.
