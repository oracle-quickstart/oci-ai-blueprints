# Model Storage

You have two options to store your model so that a recipe has access to it:

## Option 1: Object Storage

OCI AI Blueprints will automatically create an ephemeral volume, mount it to the container and download the contents of your object storage bucket.

### How To

You can host your model via object storage by:

1. Creating a PAR for the bucket that contains your model (`par` in the example below)
2. Specifying the mount location or the directory where the application inside the container will be expecting your model to be (`mount_location` in the example below)
3. The volume size for the ephermal volume: where your object storage contents will be downloaded into - so make sure the volume is large enough (`volume_size_in_gbs` in the example below)
4. The specific folder inside the object storage bucket to download - if this is not specified, the entire object storage bucket will be downloaded to the ephemeral volume (`include` in the example below)

Include the `input_object_storage` JSON object in your deployment payload (`/deployment` POST API):

```
"input_object_storage": [

	{

		"par": "https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/IFknABDAjiiF5LATogUbRCcVQ9KL6aFUC1j-P5NSeUcaB2lntXLaR935rxa-E-u1/n/iduyx1qnmway/b/corrino_hf_oss_models/o/",

		"mount_location": "/models",

		"volume_size_in_gbs": 500,

		"include": ["NousResearch/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"]

	}

],
```

Notes:

- You will need to create a PAR for the model in your object storage bucket and pass it in as shown above
- On the backend, OCI AI Blueprints creates an ephemeral volume and mounts it to the mount location directory inside the container
- The mount location is the directory inside the container that the contents of the bucket will be dumped into
- The application running inside the container will access the model from the `/models` directory (using the example above - but the directory can be renamed as you see fit)
- The application running inside the container will access the model from the /models directory (again, using the example from above)
- `include` field inside the `input_object_storage` object inside your payload (shown above) is used to specify which folder inside the bucket to download to the ephemeral volume (that the container has access to via the mount_location directory
- The entire bucket will be dumped into the ephermal volume / container mount directory if include is not provided to specify the folder inside the folder to download

## Option 2: File Storage Service (FSS)
